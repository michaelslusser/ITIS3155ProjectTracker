# ITSC3155_Project
Project for ITSC3155 - Software Engineering 

This app utilizes Flask and Python to run a website that keeps track of a user's projects and the tasks within each project. Users can add comments to projects and tasks. The site also supports changing between three preset themes, which are saved within user profiles Once a user changes their theme, logs out, and logs back in, their theme will automatically be set to their preference.

Under the venv directory, enable the virtual environment and then run the Flask application by using "flask app" in the terminal.
